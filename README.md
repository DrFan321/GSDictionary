The main objevtive of this repository is to comeplete a school assignment for my magnet class. At the current moment, progress is still being made.
While I will stop construction after the due date of the assignment, I may start again at some point just for the heck of it.

GSD is a syntax dictionary that aims to be the best in its field, incorperating 3 languages and providing desciptions of what each function does. We aim to integrate some form of AI in the future in order to make learning code easier.

Sorry about it being only HTML, its just a pain to not just use the <script> and <style> tags to go to css and js, so I just use those.
